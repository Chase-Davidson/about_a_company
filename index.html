    <h1>The Art Peddler</h1>

        <p><b>S</b>tarted the business in 2016 but have been painting her entire life.
       Art has always been a strong passion, and now I have hopes of turning
       it into something relative for you.  I can work on any platform, from
       drawing a still portrait, to re-designing your antique furniture. All
       of which has been hand crafted by us. We are now able to offer furniture
       repair as well, if needed when refurbishing a piece for you. </p>
       <p> <b>T</b>his is my Mother's passion, which I have seen grow over the years
       from just your traditional painting, to now refurbishing furniture and
       creating a business around it. I am happy to help when I can as I will always
       want to see this business succeed. </p>
